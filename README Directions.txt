Sports betting simulator. 

Chooses a random game from the 2012-2018 NBA seasons.
-The user must FIRST click "choose file" then choose nbascores.csv.
-The user must choose which team they think won that game.
-The date of the game is included.
-There is a skip button if you would like to skip the current matchup.
-After choosing team one or two, a popup will occur saying correct or false. 
-If the user selected the correct team, their win/loss record will improve, 
if they selected the losing team, their win/loss will become worse.
-Refresh to start over.


Future versions / fixes that need to be done:
-Remove "choose file" and automatically have nbascores.csv stored inside the program.
-include hints such as win/loss record of teams, ppg etc.
-popup will also tell you which team won and what the score was.
-Place on website and instead of using local files use url to store the images such as the logos.

-This program is just for my OWN use and NOT for profit. I created this just for fun to improve my skills.
-STATS are from official NBA boxscores.
-Source of CSV file was from https://www.kaggle.com/pablote/nba-enhanced-stats
-NBA LOGOS were taken from https://logoeps.com/all-nba-team-logos/31287/
-Some code was taken from source:
 https://blog.mounirmesselmeni.de/2012/11/20/reading-csv-file-with-javascript-and-html5-file-api/
This code was taking in a CSV file and storing it as an array inside array.
It allowed me to write my own code to parse the information inside of the excel file.
